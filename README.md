- [x] Deep learning with long short-term memory networks for financial market predictions ([paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221717310652), [code](https://github.com/tqa236/LSTM_algo_trading))

Use LSTM to predict out-of-sample directional movements for the constituent stocks of S&P 500 from 1992 to 2015 from Thomson Reuters. Use Diebold-Mariano test to compare different forecasts for a time series.

According to [this article](http://www.daytradingbias.com/?p=110225), "information on the S&P family of stock market indices are proprietary. That means all kinds of information about the S&P indices are not public information and that such information can only be obtained through various paid services that licensed the information directly from the owner of the S&P indices. The data you get from these paid services in turn bound you to certain limitations in terms of the scope of usage. Hence no one can make public the data they obtained directly from the source or its licensed data providers." The dataset is not free.

- [x] Factor Modeling for High-dimensional Time Series: Inference for the Number of Factors ([paper](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1337268209))

The authors "deal with the factor modeling for multivariate time series from a dimension-reduction viewpoint."

- [x] Modeling Long- and Short-Term Temporal Patterns with Deep Neural Networks

LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for time series trends.

The problem formulation is clear and easy to understand.
